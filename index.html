      <p>Insert definition of Snowflake Baby definition here</p>
      <p>Dictionary.com. (n.d.). Snowflake baby. Dictionary.com. https://www.dictionary.com/browse/snowflake-baby.</p>
      <h2>What is SnowflakeBaby.com?</h2>
      <p>SnowflakeBaby.com is a self-matching service that connects families pursuing embryo adoption to potential donors
        who
        have struggled with their own fertility issues and want to donate their unused embryos to families who need them.
      </p>
      <h2>Who Benefits?</h2>
      <h4>Embryo Donors</h4>
      <p>Potential embryo donors are stuck with the moral and ethical dilemma of how to handle unused embryos while continuing to cover the expense of long term storage fees.</p>
      <h4>Embryo Recipients</h4>
      <p>Potential recipients may be excluded from an opportunities to have their own families due to high cost of fertility treatments and traditional adoption and physical limitations that prevent natural conception.</p>
      <h4>Cryopreservation Facilities</h4>
      <p>Cryopreservation and storage facilities are exposed to legal implications of high abandonment rates and having to determine how to handle abandoned embryos.</p>
    
      <h3>Today there are an estimated 600,000 to 4 million frozen embryos stored in the United States that are abandoned or unclaimed, representing an enormous burden for clinics and storage facilities.
    
      "...reports indicate some owners of unused embryos cut off contact with clinics or storage facilities out of guilt: They want neither to have additional children nor to continue paying storage fees, but they don't want to make the
      call to have the embryos destroyed. "</h3>

      <h4>Contact Your Potential Donor/Recipient</h4>

      <h4>Agree to Terms and Make Arrangements to Transfer/Recieve Embryos</h4>
      <p>ie. transfer of storage fees, adoption agreement type, etc. Have a legal representative review documentation and make arrangements to complete the transfer to a local facility until use.</p>
      <h2>Why Choose Us?</h2>
      <h4>Cost</h4>
      <p>$25/mth to find a match for recipients (free for donors) as opposed to $2500 in non profit program fees, or ten of thousands in traditional adoption agency fees, or up to hundreds of thousands for IVF treatments.</p>
      <h4>Time</h4>
      <p>Donors & Recipients can move forward with the ‘property transfer’ as quickly, or slowly as they would like, they are not held back by agency timelines and lengthy legal processes.</p>
      <h4>Access</h4>
      <p>Donors & Recipients can choose the level of legal involvement and contractual agreements they are comfortable with.  Expensive and invasive home studies and agency interference not required.</p>
